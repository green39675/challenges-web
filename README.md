## Collaboration

We are currently in **Development stage** of the project, opened to all contributors. Feel free to contact us here and tell us about your ideas, or even better, improve our code and make a **Pull Request** for us! :mortar_board:

## Requirements

#### You are required to meet this list in order to get the website project working on your Local Device. :warning:

You'll have to have **PHP 5.6** service to run the code managing the logics of our website. We don't plan to upgrade our PHP yet.

We recommend to have some Server installed on your PC, like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), where you can launch multiple servers.

## Installation v0.6 (:smile: Don't forget to launch the Server fist)

Deployment of our project is pretty easy! :seedling:

* Download our Project and Unzip it right after :zap:

* Open your SQL Server Extension (Like [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)) 
* Launch the script `./[sql]/dauntless-challenges.sql` :volcano:
* Set the Administrator login details for the Database
* Open `./inc.php` and fill in the username and password of the Administrator account
